# Student-Management-System
Short Java project of a student management system 


The four classes - Class, Section, Exam, and Student - interact with one another to help professors manage the classes and 
sections they teach, their students, and their exams. A client code can be built using these 4 classes to keep track of 
information pertaining to any of those classes such as the list students in any particular section of a class; any student's 
overall grade as well as the grades they received on their homeworks, tests, etc; and so on. The program can also be used to 
complete tasks such as displaying a list of students for any given section in ranked order; finding the mean, median, or mode 
of a specific exam; keep track of the number of students in each section, calculate and display the average of any student, and
so on.

The AllTests.java file is a JUnit test file that tests a few of the more complex methods of the classes written.
